I have created a comprehensive React projects where each core concept is demonstrated on its own page, showcasing my skills across various essential React features. Here's a breakdown of each concept covered:

# 1. Modals:
This page demonstrates how to create and control modal windows for displaying content overlays. It includes handling open and close states, allowing you to add dialogs, forms, or notifications with ease.


# 2. Routing:
This section uses React Router to enable multi-page navigation within your single-page application. It allows users to navigate seamlessly between different components without reloading the page.


# 3. Hooks: 
Here, you’ve implemented various React hooks like useState, useEffect, and custom hooks to manage state, lifecycle methods, and other reusable functionalities efficiently.


# 4. Dark Mode and Light Mode: 
By using conditional rendering and useState, this page allows users to toggle between dark and light themes. It demonstrates how to apply different styles based on state, providing a user-friendly experience.


# 5. Context API: 
In this part, you’ve used the Context API to manage global state, making data accessible across different components without prop drilling. This is especially useful for theme management, user authentication, or other global data.

And many more

Each page is a standalone example within the repository, making it an excellent resource for showcasing my React proficiency and for use as a learning reference. This project reflects a strong grasp of React fundamentals and their practical application.































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
